        /*!Allocate an array of the provided length for the face list, and set values if given.
            The face_list is an array of integers. The first integer is the number 
            of vertices that should be connected to form the first face. For example, 
            "3" for a triangle. The next three integers (in this example) are the 
            offsets into the points array at which the three x-y-z's can be found. 
            The first point in the points array is considered to be at offset zero, 
            so "0, 1, 2" in the face_list array would form the triangle from the 
            first three entries in points. 

            Continuing with the example, a second triangle might be specified as 
            "3, 0, 1, 3", meaning "form a face using three vertices. The vertices 
            are at offsets zero, one, and three in the points array". So this second 
            face happens to share an edge---the (0, 1) edge---with the first face. 
            A third face might be "4, 1, 2, 11, 12", forming a quadrilateral. Faces 
            continue being formed until an flist_length number of integers in face_list 
            have been processed. 

            One special case: if a vertex count in the list is negative, that means 
            "continue with the previous face and subtract a polygon formed from the 
            following vertices". This allows you to build faces with true holes in 
            them. Multiple holes get an "even-odd" rule applied. A region is part of 
            the face if there are an odd number of edges between it and infinity in 
            the plane of the face. Otherwise a region is considered exterior and is 
            not drawn. The edges of the hole receive the usual edge attributes. For 
            face-numbering purposes (for example, Edit_Shell_Faces) the hole is not 
            counted separately---it's a part of the face it's in. 

            If the TKSH_TRISTRIPS bit is set in suboptions (e.g. via the functoin 
            TK_Polyhedron::SetSubop), the shell is assumed to contain triangles only and 
            may not contain holes, and the "faces" are actually the way that 
            vertices are connected into triangle strips. Start with the length of 
            the strip, followed by the vertex indices to be connected. The first 
            3 vertices form a triangle, and every additional vertex is combined 
            with the two previous ones to define one additional triangle. Exactly as 
            with OpenGL's GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP primitive, the orientation of every even 
            triangle is reversed, beginning with the second.
